<h1>ART 3400 - Space, Scale, Time: Digital Possibilities</h1>

Collection of resources for Art 3400 for anyone outside of the program who would like to follow along. 

The class will be using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HBCMYTV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title" target="_blank">this</a> Arduino Uno kit which has already been purchased with the lab fee you paid as part of the class. 

The class is divided into three sections with each section lasting four weeks.

Section 1 is a broad overview of programming foundations: We will be using <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5js</a>to learn the fundamentals of programming.

In section 2 we will learn foundational concepts for programming and working with Arduinos, small single-chip microcontrollers.

In section 3 we will merge the first two sections to create custom interactable controllers. 

Much of the course content is derived from the following books and websites.
