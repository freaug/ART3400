# ART 3400 - Space, Scale, Time: Digital Possibilities

Collection of resources for Art 3400 for anyone outside of the program who would like to follow along. 

The class will be using this [Arduino Uno](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09HBCMYTV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title) kit which has already been purchased with the lab fee you paid as part of the class. 

In this iteration of the class, we will cover the history of digital/computational art and its growth over time, and learn fundamentals in audio manipulation with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), generative art programming with [Processing](https://processing.org/), embedded electronics development with [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), web-based interactivity with [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), and 3D scene creation with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [AFrame](https://aframe.io/).

Much of the course content is derived from the following books/websites. You are not required to purchase these books, although selective readings will be used as part of class reading assignments as well as other articles and audio recordings.
