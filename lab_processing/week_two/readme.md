## Variables

Up to this point we have been hardcoding values into our commands/functions this is fine but there will come a time when you might decide to change a variable, say the red color value of a circle.  If you have many circles this could be a tedious prospect.  Luckily we have a way to create a variable that we can use to store some type of data. 

variables can be declared like this

```
int redValue = 255;
int greenValue = 100;
int blueValue = 100;

fill(redValue, greenValue, blueValue);
```
