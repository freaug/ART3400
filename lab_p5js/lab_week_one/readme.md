## Drawing in a window
* Cartesian Plane
  *  X, Y coordinate system
  *  Origin (0,0)
  *   Reference point to where objects are drawn
 
* Shapes
  *  command/name
  *  some parameters
      * point
      * circle
      * square
      * line

* [Processing Reference](https://processing.org/reference)
  *  Useful for figuring out what commands/parameters do (syntax)

* Command order determines where your shape is drawn
 
## Creating a simple sketch - In Class Assignment 

### Using what we have covered so far create a simple scene using circles, points, squares, and lines (~25 minutes)

* You should use at least 3 different 2D Primitives (shapes) in your sketch
* You should have at least 10 shapes in your sketch
* Optional: include a shape from the [2D Primitives](https://processing.org/reference/#shape) portion of the Processing Reference page

If you're having trouble visualizing what you would like to create I find it can be helpful to first draw out an idea and then use it as a reference for figuring out the location and size of shapes. 

### Saving your code

Saving your projects and submitting them through iCollege will be the main way grades are calculated in this class. To ensure you receive full credit make sure to save projects correctly:

lastname_firstname_in_class_assignment_1

for example, I would name my file: farr_eddie_in_class_assignment_1

Why the naming scheme?  There are many of you and one of me.  This naming scheme will make it easy for me to grade and return assignments in a timely fashion.

## Color

Now that we've written a sketch, let's add some color to it!

### Greyscale
So far we just have greyscale colors represented in our sketch, the background of our sketch is a shade of grey, shapes are filled in with white, and have a black outline. 

*  In processing color values range from 0 - 255 With 0 being black and 255 being white. Below are some commands that we can use to set the color of certain parts of our sketch.
  * background
    * sets the sketch background color 
  * fill
    * sets the interior color of a shape 
  * stroke
    * sets the color of the border of a shape
