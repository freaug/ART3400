# Week 2

This week will focus on Analog Input, Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), Sounds, and making a few simple interactive projects. We will also further our understanding of [conditional logic](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/if/) and control structures.  

### Group Review:

As a group, we will write some code and build a circuit that will allow us to turn a single LED on when a button is pressed three times. (10 - 15 minutes)

### New Components

This week we will look at the following components from our kits.

* Photoresistor
* Potentiometer
* Passive Speaker
* Active Speaker
* Tilt Switch
* Seven Segment Display

## Group 

Taking what we have learned let's build a circuit and write a program that will turn on three different LEDs based on the position of a potentiometer or a photoresistor. 

### Materials Needed
* Arduino
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wires
* Resistors x4
* LED x3
* Potentiometer
* Photoresistor

In Class Activity 3 - Push Button Audio

### Materials Needed
* Arduino
* Breadboard

## Lab Assignment/Homework

Choose One of the following.  Make sure to document your project with photos and videos and make sure to submit your code. 

Building on the above example build a circuit and write a program that turns on a single segment of 7 segment display based on the position of the potentiometer.
