# Arduino Week One
We will be using an Arduino <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3" target="_blank">Uno</a> for class activities as well as a selection of electrical components.

An Arduino is a microcontroller that can be considered a self-contained system with a processor, memory, and peripherals and can be used as an embedded system.  Most microcontrollers today are embedded in other machinery, such as automobiles, telephones, appliances, and peripherals for computer systems. [1] <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/uno-rev3/intro-to-board" target="_blank">Here</a> is a reference article about the Arduino Uno board. 

What are some objects you interact with every day that might have a microcontroller as part of their design?

In this first week, we will only look at a few components from your kits listed below as well as circled in red in the following image. 

* Arduino Uno
* USB Cable 
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wire
* LED (Light Emitting Diode)
* RGB LED (Red Green Blue Light Emitting Diode)
* Resistor
* Buttons

### Together:

[In Class Activity 1](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/uno-rev3/Blink) - Blinking LED, click on the link to see the circuit diagram and code for this example.

#### Materials Needed:
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wire
* Resistor
* LED

[In Class Activity 2](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/basics/DigitalReadSerial) - Button Press, click on the link to see the circuit diagram and code for this example.

#### Materials Needed:
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wire
* Resistor
* Button

### Individual:

Taking what we have learned see if you can turn the LED on when you press and hold down the button. (10 - 15 minutes)

#### Materials Needed:
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wire
* Resistor x 2
* LED
* Button

### Together:

[In Class Activity 3](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples/StateChangeDetection) - State Detection, click on the link to see the circuit diagram and code for this example.

#### Materials Needed:
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wire
* Resistor x 2
* LED
* Button

## Lab Assignment / Homework

Now that we can know the state of a button it's time to do something slightly more interesting than just turning on one LED.  For this assignment, I would like you to use the RGB LED and three buttons.  Have one of the buttons be able to turn on the red channel, another to turn on the green channel, and the final button to turn on the blue channel.  

Below is a list of materials you will need to complete the assignment.  Make sure to submit a photo of your completed circuit and a short video of your project in action. Be sure to also submit your code with comments for each section. 

If you get stuck review the three in-class exercises. 

#### Materials Needed:
* Breadboard
* Jumper Wire
* Resistor x 6
* RGB LED
* Button x 3
